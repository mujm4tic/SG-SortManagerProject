# SG-SortManagerProject
Sort Manager project for Sparta Global SDET training (Engineering 107)

## Description

An array sorting manager containing the following elements

- BubbleSort
- InsertionSort
- MergeSort (iterative or recursive)
- QuickSort
- SelectionSort
- BinaryTreeSort


### Task Requirements

Client is presented with a number of sort algorithms to choose from
Decision is given via the command line (Scanner)
The program will then ask for the length of an array again via the command line (Scanner)
The program should then output:
The unsorted randomly generated array
The sort algorith to be used
The sorted array after the algorith has been executed
The time taken
You are required to test both the functionality of the program and the peformance of the algorithms (speed tests)

 
Additional features for continuous improvement:
- GUI
- Logging
- Generic Sorts (Consider interaction with a suitable interface)
- Good code structure in accordance with design patterns (refactoring)


### More Information

This repository contains a main, dev, and feature branch. Features a created and uploaded to the dev branch, then at the end
of the project will be uploaded to the main branch.
